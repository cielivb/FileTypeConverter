## About FileTypeConverter

FileTypeConverter is a wxPython GUI application for converting between different image file types. 

FileTypeConverter enables the user to:
- Convert image files to BMP, ICO, JPG, PDF, PNG, TIFF, and WEBP formats
- Specify converted file destination (default to same directory as original file)


### FileTypeConverter Motivation

FileTypeConverter was developed to streamline conversion between different image file types. This is useful both as a general utility tool and for developing tests for programs that handle various image file types.


### Future development

FileTypeConverter is designed to be a very simple utility tool, and thus has no major updates proposed for the foreseeable future.



## How to Use FileTypeConverter

Download the zip file from github, and extract it wherever you like. In the dist folder, you should find File Type Converter.exe. Run this either from the terminal or by left clicking on it.
